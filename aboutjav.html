              <h2 class="test"><b class="b">JAVA</b>

                  <p>Java is a versatile and widely-used programming language known for its platform independence and robustness. Developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle), Java's "write once, run anywhere" philosophy allows it to run on various operating systems without modification. Its object-oriented nature and extensive library support make it a popular choice for building a wide range of applications, from web and mobile to enterprise-level software.</p>

                      <h4 class="test"><b class="b">JDK</b>

                          <p >The Java Development Kit, commonly referred to as JDK, is a crucial component of Java development. It provides tools and utilities required for developing, compiling, and running Java applications and applets. Here are the main components of JDK:
                              
                              Java Compiler: JDK includes the Java compiler (javac), which translates Java source code into bytecode, an intermediate form of code that can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
                              Java Virtual Machine (JVM): JDK contains a JVM for executing Java bytecode. The JVM is platform-specific and ensures that Java code can run on various operating systems without modification.
                              Development Tools: JDK offers a set of development tools such as debugger (jdb), documentation generator (javadoc), and more, aiding in efficient Java development.
                              Java APIs (Application Programming Interfaces): JDK includes a vast collection of pre-written classes and libraries that simplify Java application development.
                            </p>
                        </h4>
                    
            
                    
                    
                      <h4 class="test"><b class="b">JVM</b>

                          <p>The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a crucial component of Java's platform independence. It interprets and executes bytecode produced by the Java compiler. JVMs are available for various platforms, making it possible to run Java applications on Windows, macOS, Linux, and more. JVM manages memory, handles exceptions, and provides runtime support for Java applications.</p>

                      <h4 class="test"><b class="b">JRE</b>

                          <p>The Java Runtime Environment, or JRE, is essential for running Java applications on a computer. It includes the JVM and necessary libraries but does not contain development tools. When you run a Java program on your computer, you need the JRE to execute it. JRE ensures the compatibility and proper execution of Java applications.</p>
